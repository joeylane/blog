Even if you follow a strict patch management process, deploy an IDS/IPS solution, run antivirus on all your hosts, and regularly monitor logs and events, there is still always a chance that a skilled attacker could breach your network.

There are no shortage of security solutions out there promising to offer the highest level of protection, but realistically any security control can be bypassed under the right circumstances.</description></item></channel></rss>
